# Capstone-Project
Final project of the FEWD-Techdegree

The cumulation of the front-end web development knowledge earned throughout the duration of the team treehouse front-end web developer Techdegree. Skills used include Html structuring, JavaScript interaction, CSS and Sass styling, and Bootstrap. Special quirks and features include the "do a flip" feature in the bottom left corner and the translate feature as my Hispanic heritage is very important to me.
